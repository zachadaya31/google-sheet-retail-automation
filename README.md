Made a Google Spreadsheets Apps Script that automates getting information from the Home Depot Website
it uses SerpAPI to scrape data such as product's brand, title, price, description, and image url just by entering the product model number in column A
just slap this baby onto your Apps Script in Spreadsheets and put: 
(column A) Model, 
(column B) Number,	
(column C) Brand,	
(column D) Title,	
(column E) Price,	
(column F) URL,	
(column G and H) Last Updated:	Last Updated:

or... I could also probably automate that, but here's working proof for a google sheet automatic web scraper. :)
